# infrastructure-as-code

This repo contains the source code related to Infrastructure as code (IaC), IaC is a method of provisioning and managing infrastructure using code and automation, rather than manual configuration.

Here we are going to use Terraform for the IaC, Terraform is a tool for infrastructure as code, which allow us to define and provision infrastructure resources using configuration files written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). With Terraform, we can describe the desired state of your infrastructure and the tool will automatically create, update, or delete resources as needed to achieve that state.
